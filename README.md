# What is PromptML?

PromptML is a lightweight, human- and machine-readable format for the structured description of characters, scenes, and context elements for generative AI applications. It is designed to enable repeatable, comprehensible, and shareable prompts—particularly in areas such as image generation, comic creation, learning materials, or interactive stories.

## Basic Idea

PromptML is based on YAML ("Yet Another Markup Language") and is a semantic layer over simple prompts. It separates the description of a character or scene from the concrete request to the AI to generate an image or text.

---

## Advantages

- **Reusability**: Figures and scenes can be versioned and combined
- **Consistency**: Recognizable characters across panels
- **Extensibility**: New fields and modules can be easily added
- **Readability**: Clear structure for humans and easy further processing with tools

---

## Use Cases

- **Prompt Generation**: AI-supported prompt builders that generate templates for image or text systems from YAML data
- **Storytelling**: Interactive narrative structures with semantically defined roles and locations
- **Comics**: Characters and scenes can be presented reproducibly and stylistically coherently
- **Learning Materials**: Teaching characters in thematic scenes (math, language, history)

---

## Outlook

PromptML is deliberately open and modular. Possible options include:

- **Templates for roles, genres, or styles**
- **Rating grids for coherence (e.g., clothing, color codes)**
- **Versioning systems for creative development processes**
- **Bridges to tools such as Markdown, Pandoc, LaTeX, and web platforms**

## Conclusion

PromptML isn't a new data format—it's a new perspective on creative prompting: structured, modular, transparent, and sustainable. It helps humans and machines **understand complexity**, **structure creativity**, and **collaboratively design reproducible content**.
