# What is promptGenML?

**promptGenML** is a prompt composition system for generative art – especially **image, music, and scene synthesis** using AI models like Midjourney, SDXL, or Suno. Unlike conventional prompt-engine tools designed for GPT-style text generation, `promptGenML` is built around **visual logic, poetic tropes, and narrative fragments**.

## Not Just Another Prompt Template Tool

While tools like Microsoft’s `prompt-engine` focus on **LLM use cases** (tasks, roles, examples, instructions), `promptGenML` answers a different question:

> _How can I **compose** a scene, figure, or atmosphere that guides image or audio generation?_

This involves **symbolic language**, **compositional logic**, and **aesthetic intent** – more like a _storyboard_ or _moodboard_ than an input/output pattern.

## Core Distinctions

| Feature                  | `promptGenML`                             | LLM Prompt Engines                      |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Target output**        | Image, music, scene generation            | Text generation (GPT, Claude, etc.)     |
| **Medium-first design**  | Visual, acoustic, poetic                  | Functional, textual                     |
| **Structure**            | YAML-based, modular (figures, tropes…)   | Prompt templates with variables         |
| **Use case**             | Artists, creators, storytellers           | Developers, analysts, educators         |
| **Prompt logic**         | Evocative, associative                    | Instructional, goal-directed            |
| **Language mode**        | Metaphoric, symbolic                      | Propositional, literal                  |

## Use promptGenML if you...

- ...want to **shape mood, style, composition**, not just behavior.
- ...work with **generative image or audio models**, not just chatbots.
- ...prefer to define **characters, tropes, settings**, not only tasks and roles.
- ...see prompting as **scene-writing**, not just question-answering.
